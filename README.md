# Bank-Architecture
This project is an example of a microservices-based architecture for a banking system. The architecture is designed to be scalable, reliable, and maintainable, while providing high performance and security.

Bank-Architecture is a sample project that illustrates the C4 model for designing a solution for a bank.

The project includes a set of diagrams that describe the main architectural elements of the bank system, from the business context to the technology stack. 

# Architecture

[Bank Architecture](https://github.com/diogo1z/Bank-Architecture/blob/main/Bank%20Architecture.png) is an image that brings a macro view of the systems architecture and the technologies used

Context diagram: this diagram shows the high-level context of the bank system, including the external actors and the systems it interacts with. The context diagram helps to establish the scope of the system and the boundaries of the architecture.

Container diagram: this diagram shows the main containers (e.g., web application, API, database) that make up the bank system, their dependencies, and the technologies they use. The container diagram helps to define the major components of the system and their interactions.

Component diagram: this diagram shows the main components (e.g., user interface, authentication, accounts, transactions) that make up each container, their responsibilities, and their relationships. The component diagram helps to break down the system into manageable units and define their interfaces.

# Bank Software Develoment Methodologies

The [Bank Software Development Methodology.odt](https://github.com/diogo1z/Bank-Architecture/blob/main/Bank%20Software%20Development%20Methodology.odt) is a Doc file with the methodology to be followed in development, technology stack and processes that developers must follow on a daily basis.
