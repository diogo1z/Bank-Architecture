# Bank-Architecture
This project is an example of a microservices-based architecture for a banking system. The architecture is designed to be scalable, reliable, and maintainable, while providing high performance and security.

Bank-Architecture is a sample project that illustrates the C4 model for designing a solution for a bank. The C4 model is a lightweight, hierarchical approach for describing and communicating software architecture, based on four levels: context, containers, components, and code.

The project includes a set of diagrams that describe the main architectural elements of the bank system, from the business context to the technology stack. The diagrams are created using the Structurizr platform, which is a cloud-based tool for creating and sharing software architecture models.

Architecture
The architecture of the bank system is organized into four main levels, each represented by a separate diagram:

Context diagram: this diagram shows the high-level context of the bank system, including the external actors and the systems it interacts with. The context diagram helps to establish the scope of the system and the boundaries of the architecture.

Container diagram: this diagram shows the main containers (e.g., web application, API, database) that make up the bank system, their dependencies, and the technologies they use. The container diagram helps to define the major components of the system and their interactions.

Component diagram: this diagram shows the main components (e.g., user interface, authentication, accounts, transactions) that make up each container, their responsibilities, and their relationships. The component diagram helps to break down the system into manageable units and define their interfaces.

Usage
The Bank-Architecture project is intended to be used as a reference for designing software architectures using the C4 model. The diagrams can be viewed and edited using the Structurizr platform, which requires a free account to use.

To view the diagrams, simply open the URL of each diagram in a web browser:

To edit the diagrams, you can create a free account on Structurizr and import the workspace using the "Import" feature. Once imported, you can modify the diagrams and export them in various formats, such as PNG, SVG, and PDF.
